Hello, this is a password generator. You'll use it to make a new password including capital letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. 

I had help in a tutoring session with Scott Everett and lines 23-60 are where I received the most help. I also worked with my classmate Juan Martinez to determine lines 64-80.
